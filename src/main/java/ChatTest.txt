14/4/19 22:41 - Ben: Kosmoceratops (/ˌkɒzməˈsɛrətɒps/[1]) is a genus of ceratopsid dinosaur that lived in North America about 76.4–75.5 million
14/4/19 22:57 - Ben: years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Specimens were discovered in Utah in the Kaiparowits Formation of
14/4/19 22:57 - Ben: the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 2006 and 2007, including an adult skull and postcranial skeleton
14/4/19 23:03 - Ben: and partial subadults. In 2010, the adult was made the holotype of the new genus and species Kosmoceratops richardson
14/4/19 23:04 - Ben: ; the generic name means "ornate horned face", and the specific name honors Scott Richardson, who found the specimens.
14/4/19 23:06 - Ben: The find was part of a spate of ceratopsian discoveries in the early 21st century, and Kosmoceratops was considered
14/4/19 23:07 - Ben: significant due to its elaborate skull ornamentation.
14/4/19 23:12 - Ben: Kosmoceratops had an estimated length of 4.5 m (15 ft) and a weight of 1.2 t (1.3 short tons). As a ceratopsid, it would
14/4/19 23:31 - Ben: have been quadrupedal with a heavily constructed skeleton. It had a triangular beak with a pointed tip and a
14/4/19 23:32 - Ben: blade-like nasal horn with a flattened upper portion. While the horns above the eyes were oriented forwards or
14/4/19 23:33 - Ben: hindwards in most of its relatives, the horns of Kosmoceratops pointed up and to the sides, then downwards, ending
14/4/19 23:33 - Ben: in pointed tips. The neck frill was short from front to back, with small parietal fenestrae (openings through the
14/4/19 23:33 - Ben: frill), and ten hook-like processes on the hind margin, with eight curving forwards and two curving to the sides.
14/4/19 23:34 - Ben: With fifteen well-developed horns and horn-like structures, it possessed the most ornate skull in any known dinosaurs.
14/4/19 23:34 - Ben: Kosmoceratops was a chasmosaurine ceratopsid and was originally suggested to be closely related to Vagaceratops
14/4/19 23:34 - Ben: (which also had forward-curving processes on the back of the frill) but this has been debated, some authors finding
14/4/19 23:34 - Ben: the latter closer to Chasmosaurus. Kosmoceratops is also considered closely related to Spiclypeus, which had a
14/4/19 23:35 - Ben: similar frill.

14/4/19 23:35 - Ben: Studies of bone histology show that Kosmoceratops grew rapidly and had an elevated metabolism, similar to modern birds
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: and mammals. The teeth of ceratopsids were adapted to processing fibrous plants; coprolites (fossilized dung) from the
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: Kaiparowits Formation that contain wood may have been produced by ceratopsids. The functions of ceratopsian frills and
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: horns have been debated, including display, combat, and species recognition. The Kaiparowits Formation dates to the late
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: Campanian age and was deposited on Laramidia, an island continent, when North America was divided at the center by the Western
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: Interior Seaway. This environment was dominated by wetlands and supported a diverse fauna, including dinosaurs such as the
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: chasmosaurine Utahceratops. Based in part on the relationship between Kosmoceratops and other chasmosaurines from around the same
14/4/19 23:40 - Ben: time, it has been proposed that Laramidia was divided into dinosaur "provinces" with separate endemic zones (this interpretation
14/4/19 23:40 - Ben: suggests that Kosmoceratops in the south was most closely related to the geographically separated Vagaceratops in the north),
14/4/19 23:40 - Ben: but this has been contested.

14/4/19 23:36 - Ben:  On the night of March 9-10, 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) conducted a devastating firebombing raid on Tokyo, the Japanese capital city. This attack was code-named Operation Meetinghouse by the USAAF and is known as the Great Tokyo Air Raid in Japan.[1] Bombs dropped from 279 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers burned out much of eastern Tokyo. More than 90,000 and possibly over 100,000 Japanese were killed, mostly civilians, and one million were left homeless, making it the most destructive single air attack of World War II. The Japanese air and civil defenses proved largely inadequate, although 14 American aircraft and 96 airmen were lost.

                          The attack on Tokyo was an intensification of the air raids on Japan which had commenced in June 1944. Prior to this operation, the USAAF had focused on a precision bombing campaign against Japanese industrial facilities. These attacks were generally unsuccessful, which contributed to the decision to shift to firebombing. The operation during the early hours of March 10 was the first major firebombing raid against a Japanese city, and the USAAF units employed significantly different tactics from those used in precision raids, including bombing by night with the aircraft flying at low altitudes. The extensive destruction caused by the raid led to these tactics becoming standard for the USAAF's B-29s until the end of the war.

                          There has been a long-running debate over the morality of the March 10 firebombing of Tokyo. The raid is often cited as a key example in criticism of the Allies' strategic bombing campaigns, with many historians and commentators arguing that it was not acceptable for the USAAF to deliberately target civilians, and other historians stating that the USAAF had no choice but to change to area bombing tactics given that the precision bombing campaign had failed. It is generally acknowledged that the tactics used against Tokyo and in similar subsequent raids were militarily successful. The attack is commemorated at two official memorials, several neighborhood memorials, and a privately run museum.
14/4/19 23:36 - Ben: Departure
                     On 8 March LeMay issued orders for a major firebombing attack on Tokyo the next night.[68] The raid was to target a rectangular area in northeastern Tokyo designated Zone I by the USAAF which measured approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) by 3 miles (4.8 km). This area was divided by the Sumida River, and included most of Asakusa, Honjo and Fukagawa Wards.[69] These wards formed part of the informally defined Shitamachi district of Tokyo, which was mainly populated by working-class people and artisans.[70] With a population of around 1.1 million, it was one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world.[71] Zone I contained few militarily significant industrial facilities, though there were a large number of small factories which supplied Japan's war industries. The area was highly vulnerable to firebombing, as most buildings were constructed from wood and bamboo and were closely spaced.[52] Due to this vulnerability, it had suffered extensive damage and heavy casualties from fires caused by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The United States' intelligence services were aware of how vulnerable the region remained to fire, with the Office of Strategic Services rating it as containing the most combustible districts in Tokyo.[72]

                     The orders for the raid issued to the B-29 crews stated that the main purpose of the attack was to destroy the many small factories located within the target area, but also noted that it was intended to cause civilian casualties as a means of disrupting production at major industrial facilities.[73] Each of XXI Bomber Command's three wings was allocated a different altitude to bomb from, in bands between 5,000 feet (1,500 m) and 7,000 feet (2,100 m). These altitudes were calculated to be too high for the light Japanese antiaircraft guns to reach, and below the effective range of the heavy antiaircraft guns.[56]

                     LeMay was unable to lead the raid in person as he had been prohibited from placing himself in a situation where he could be captured after being briefed on the development of atomic bombs.[44] Instead, the attack was led by the 314th Bombardment Wing's commanding officer, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power.[74] LeMay considered Power to be the best of the wing commanding officers.[75] The new tactics which were to be used in the operation were not well received by many airmen, who believed that it was safer to bomb from high altitudes and preferred to retain their defensive guns.[45] Leaving behind the unneeded gunners also troubled many of the airmen, as bomber crews typically had a very close relationship.[76]

                     In preparation for the attack, XXI Bomber Command's maintenance staff worked intensively over a 36-hour period to ready as many aircraft as possible. This effort proved successful, and 83 percent of the B-29s were available for action compared to the average serviceability rate of 60 percent. Other ground crew loaded the aircraft with bombs and fuel.[77] A total of 346 B-29s were readied. The 73d Bombardment Wing contributed 169 B-29s and the 313th Bombardment Wing 121; both units were based on Saipan. At the time of the raid the 314th Bombardment Wing was arriving at Guam in the Marianas, and able to provide only 56 B-29s.[44] The B-29s in the squadrons which were scheduled to arrive over Tokyo first were armed with M47 bombs; these weapons used napalm and were capable of starting fires which required mechanized firefighting equipment to control. The bombers in the other units were loaded with clusters of M69s.[68] The 73d and 313th Bomb Wings' Superfortresses were each loaded with 7 short tons (6.4 t) of bombs. As the 314th Bombardment Wing's B-29s would have to fly a greater distance, they each carried 5 short tons (4.5 t) of bombs.[56]

                     The attack force began departing its bases at 5:35 pm local time on 9 March. It took two and three quarter hours for all of the 325 B-29s which were dispatched to take off.[52][56] Turbulence was encountered on the flight to Japan, but the weather over Tokyo was good. There was little cloud cover, and visibility was good for the first bomber crews to arrive over Tokyo; they were able to see clearly for 10 miles (16 km).[52] Conditions on the ground were cold and windy, with the city experiencing gusts of between 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) and 67 miles per hour (108 km/h) blowing from the southeast.[78][79]

                     The first B-29s over Tokyo were four aircraft tasked with guiding the others in. These Superfortresses arrived over the city shortly before midnight on 9 March. They carried extra fuel, additional radios and XXI Bomber Command's best radio operators instead of bombs, and circled Tokyo at an altitude of 25,000 feet (7,600 m) throughout the raid. This tactic proved unsuccessful, and was later judged to have been unnecessary.[80]
